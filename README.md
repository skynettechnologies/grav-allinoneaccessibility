## Installation

Installing the **All in One Accessibility** plugin can be done in one of three ways: The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method lets you quickly install the plugin with a simple terminal command, the manual method lets you do so via a zip file, and the admin method lets you do so via the Admin Plugin.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

To install the plugin via the [GPM](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm), through your system's terminal (also called the command line), navigate to the root of your Grav-installation, and enter:

    bin/gpm install allinoneaccessibility

This will install the All in One Accessibility plugin into your `/user/plugins`-directory within Grav.
Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/allinoneaccessibility`.

Its data files are saved under
`/your/site/grav/user/data/allinone-manager`.


In Plugin Settings you can change the storage folder to pages/assets.

`/your/site/grav/pages/assets/allinone-manager`.

### Manual Installation

To install the plugin manually, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then rename the folder to `allinoneaccessibility`.

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/allinoneaccessibility

## Configuration

```yaml
enabled: true
data_storage: pages
```

Note that if you use the Admin Plugin, a file with your configuration named allinoneaccessibility.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/`-folder once the configuration is saved in the Admin.
